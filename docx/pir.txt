# motion detection by gpio (general purpose input output) config
pir sensor essentially required 3 cables [to connect raspberry pi]
  - GND
  - VCC
  - OUT
connection to Pi:
  - pir's pin GND is connected to pi's pin 9 which is Ground
  - pir's pin VCC is connected to pi's pin 1 which is 3.3V
  - pir's pin OUT is connected to pi's pin 7 which is gpio used as input coming from pir
reading sensor data:
first of all we need to set the mode of the gpio
  - board
  - bcm
  - wiringpi
let's have a study on pin config from https://pinout.xyz/
since pir's pin GND and VCC is connected to pi's Ground (pin 1) and VCC (pin 1). So, we 
do not need to worry about those but we should care about the input coming into pi. pi has two 
different ways to grab the input depending on the mode. pi uses gpio (general purpose 
input output) to get the input from any device to connected to it. https://pinout.xyz/ 
shows detail pin configuration of pi's pin and their uses.  
raspberry pi 3 having 40 pins has been used for this experiment. for all mode (board, bcm & wiringpi)
we have use physical pin 7. this pin has diferrent numbering system on for all mode to get the input.
  - pi's physical pin 7 used board's and wiringpi's pin 7
  - pi's physical pin 7 used bcm's pin 4
