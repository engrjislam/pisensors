# python's config for pir motion sensor like rpi.gpio installation
quiz: how to install the dependencies for pir motion sensor on python?
ans-: 
  # update apt package manager
  sudo apt-get update
  # upgrade apt package manager -- not necessary 
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  # install rpi.gpio for python 2x
  sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio

# motion detection by gpio (general purpose input output) config
pir sensor essentially required 3 cables [to connect raspberry pi]
  - GND
  - VCC
  - OUT
connection to Pi:
  - pir's pin GND is connected to pi's pin 9 which is Ground
  - pir's pin VCC is connected to pi's pin 1 which is 3.3V
  - pir's pin OUT is connected to pi's pin 7 which is gpio used as input coming from pir
reading sensor data:
first of all we need to set the mode of the gpio
  - board
  - bcm
let's have a study on pin config from https://pinout.xyz/
since pir's pin GND and VCC is connected to pi's pin with appropriate meaning ...
